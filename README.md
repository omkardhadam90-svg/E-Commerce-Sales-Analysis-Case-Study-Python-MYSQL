# E-Commerce Sales Analysis — Case Study  
### Turning Sales Data Into Smarter Decisions for Growth    
**Tech Stack:** Python, MySQL

---

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes sales performance for an Indian fashion retailer selling on Amazon.in.  
The company is facing **high cancellations**, **delivery delays**, and **fulfillment issues**.

The goal of this case study is to uncover insights using, 
**Python** for data cleaning and **MySQL** for business analysis. <br>
<br>
This project answers crucial business questions such as:

- Why are cancellations increasing?
- Is **Amazon Fulfillment** or **Merchant Fulfillment** performing better?
- Which products bring the highest revenue?
- Which states/cities should get more marketing investment?
- Does expedited shipping really improve delivery success?


The project provides recommendations for improving sales, reducing cancellations, and optimizing fulfillment.

##  Business Analysis Using SQL

##  **1. Sales Overview**
### Q1.1 Total revenue generated from successfully completed orders (exclude cancelled orders).
-> select sum(Amount) as Revenue_by_Completed_Orders from sales<br>
where Status="Delivered";  
![Q1.1](https://github.com/omkardhadam90-svg/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Case-Study-Python-MYSQL/blob/fc13703482aae97676f719187c734f1df34254c2/IMAGES/Screenshot%202025-11-21%20013127.png)


### Q1.2 What is the overall cancellation rate? Calculate both by order count and by revenue value.

#### Cancelation rate by Order Count :- 
-> select round(count(Order_ID)/(select count(Order_ID) from sales)*100,2) as Cancellation_rate_By_Order_count from sales<br>
where Status="Cancelled";<br>
![Q1.2.1](https://github.com/omkardhadam90-svg/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Case-Study-Python-MYSQL/blob/41cd71c3247ddad9eae683499343de0b34263b68/IMAGES/Q.1.2.1.png)
#### Cancelation rate by Revenue:-
->select round(sum(Amount)/(select sum(Amount) from sales)*100,2) as Cancellation_rate_By_Revenue from sales<br>
where Status="cancelled";<br>
![Q1.2.2](https://github.com/omkardhadam90-svg/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Case-Study-Python-MYSQL/blob/41cd71c3247ddad9eae683499343de0b34263b68/IMAGES/Q.1.2.2.png)
---
### Q1.3 What is the average order value (AOV) for completed orders?

-> select round(avg(Amount),2) as Completed_Order_Average_Value from sales<br>
where Status="Delivered";<br>
![Q1.3](https://github.com/omkardhadam90-svg/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Case-Study-Python-MYSQL/blob/41cd71c3247ddad9eae683499343de0b34263b68/IMAGES/Q1.3.png)


### Q1.4 Create a summary showing total orders, completed orders, cancelled orders, and total revenue.
-> select count(Order_ID) as Total_Orders,<br>
(select count(Order_ID) from sales where Status="Delivered") as Completed_Orders,<br>
(select count(Order_ID) from sales where Status="Cancelled") as Cancelled_Orders,<br>
(select round(sum(Amount),2) from sales where status="Delivered") as Total_Revenue<br>
from sales;<br>
![Q1.4](https://github.com/omkardhadam90-svg/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Case-Study-Python-MYSQL/blob/41cd71c3247ddad9eae683499343de0b34263b68/IMAGES/Q1.4.png)

###  **2. Fulfillment Analysis**  

### Q2.1 Compare the cancellation rates between Amazon fulfillment and Merchant fulfillment. Which performs better?

-> with<br>
cancel_orders as(<br>
select Fulfilment,count(Order_ID) as cancel_count from sales<br>
where status="Cancelled"<br>
group by Fulfilment<br>
),<br>
total_orders as(<br>
select Fulfilment,count(Order_ID) as total_count from sales<br>
group by Fulfilment<br>
)<br>
select<br> 
c.Fulfilment,t.total_count,c.cancel_count,round((c.cancel_count/t.total_count)*100,2) as<br> Cancellation_Rate from cancel_orders c<br>
join total_orders t on t.Fulfilment=c.Fulfilment;<br>

![Q2.1](https://github.com/omkardhadam90-svg/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Case-Study-Python-MYSQL/blob/acea8cb128bc446e53dd3535b5117c5d9368e005/IMAGES/Q2.1.png)

### Q2.2 Calculate the total revenue generated by each fulfillment method.

-> select Fulfilment,round(sum(Amount),2) as Revenue from sales
where Status="Delivered" 
group by Fulfilment;

![Q2.2](https://github.com/omkardhadam90-svg/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Case-Study-Python-MYSQL/blob/acea8cb128bc446e53dd3535b5117c5d9368e005/IMAGES/Q.2.2.png)

### Q2.3 What is the average order value for each fulfillment type?
-> select fulfilment,round(avg(Amount),2) as Average_Order_Value from sales
group by fulfilment;

![Q2.3](https://github.com/omkardhadam90-svg/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Case-Study-Python-MYSQL/blob/acea8cb128bc446e53dd3535b5117c5d9368e005/IMAGES/Q2.3.png)

### Q2.4 Based on your analysis, which fulfillment method would you recommend and why?
#### ->  MY ANSWER -> 
- Merchent has AOV 617 which is littlebit more than AMAZON AOV 605<br>
BUT, 
- Merchant Fulfillment has **higher successful deliveries**  
- Amazon Fulfillment has **0 delivered orders** → all remain "Shipped / Transit / Pending"  
- High pending time may directly lead to cancellations.

**Conclusion:**  
Merchant Fulfillment is better for now,  
but Amazon Fulfillment has a *higher volume and higher future potential* **if delivery issues are fixed**.

### Q6.2 Identify any patterns: Do certain categories perform better with specific fulfillment methods?
->All the Categories are perfoming well but only with Merchent.. Because Amazon fulfilment have not yet Delivered any
Product Successfully..<br>
If we sepcifically talk about **Merchent Fulfilment** then,
- **Set - 88,00,562/- --- 47 %**
- **kurta - 47,15,208/- --- 25.3 %**
- **Western Dress - 38,67,845/- --- 20.7 %**<br>

![Q6.4](https://github.com/omkardhadam90-svg/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Case-Study-Python-MYSQL/blob/80bd91421305e22f6bd472f9ccab71dfeeac9e4e/IMAGES/Q6.4.png)

# Business Recommendations

### Q7.1 Should the company focus more on Amazon fulfillment or Merchant fulfillment? Why?  
- Company Should focus more on Amazon fullfilment.
- As people have more Trust on Amazon so Amazon Fulfillment has Almost Double the No. of Merchant
Fulfilment Orders.
- But in this given Data all the Amazon fulfilment Orders are in Transit/Shipped/Pending State.
- This may Break people trust and lead to Orders Cancellations as well as Decrease in No. of Orders.
- If attention is given and issues are resolved. Amazon Fulfillment has Higher potential of Revenue Generation.

### Q7.2 Which 3 states should receive increased marketing investment? 
-> select ship_state,count(Order_ID) as Number_Of_Orders  from sales<br>
group by ship_state<br>
order by Number_Of_Orders desc<br>
limit 3;<br>

![Q7.2](https://github.com/omkardhadam90-svg/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Case-Study-Python-MYSQL/blob/c015c3feb852efda139b6836f2907414e23aabc9/IMAGES/Q7.2.png)

- **Maharashtra - 22,259 Orders.**
- **Karnataka - 17,325 Orders.**
- **TamilNadu - 11,483 Orders.** <br>
These are the **Top-3** States having Highest No.of Orders.
This indicated that there are more Active Buyers in these
States.
So **Increasing Marketing Investment** in these States can
**boost Orders Count**.
This idea may Increase Company Sales and **Generate More
Profit**.

### Q7.3 Which product categories should be prioritized for inventory expansion?
->select Category,count(Order_ID) as Orders_Count from sales<br>
group by Category<br>
order by Orders_Count desc;<br>

![Q7.3](https://github.com/omkardhadam90-svg/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Case-Study-Python-MYSQL/blob/c015c3feb852efda139b6836f2907414e23aabc9/IMAGES/Q7.3.png)

- **Set - 50,280 Orders.**
- **Kurta - 49,874 Orders.**<br>
These are the **Top-2** categories having Highest No.of
Orders.
These 2 Categories **Inventory Expansion** should be
Prioritized.
So that the orders will not be in pending state for longer
time.



---

### Q7.4 What strategies would you suggest to reduce the cancellation rate?  

- The Main reason behind Order cancellation is, Order pending
for longertime and taking more time in delivering the product
to customer.
- In this data Amazon Fulfillment has not delivered any of the
orders. All of its orders are in Shipped/Pending/Transit State.
- This may increase the cancellation rate.

  ## Suggestion :-
- Focus should be given on processing the orders fast.
so that it stays in Pending state for **Minimum-Time**.
- Ensuring **Timely delivery** of Products will surely **Decrease the
Cancellation Rate**.
